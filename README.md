# Puter.js Web App Builder

<!-- Placeholder image, replace with an actual logo if you create one -->

A cutting-edge, AI-powered web application builder that streamlines frontend development. Describe your desired web app, optionally provide an image, and watch as the AI generates a complete, single-page HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript solution. This project leverages the power of [Puter.js](https://developer.puter.com/) to provide serverless AI capabilities directly in your browser, entirely free for developers and without the need for API keys.

## ‚ú® Features

* **AI-Powered Generation:** Describe your web app idea in natural language, and the AI will generate the corresponding HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

* **Image-to-Code (Conceptual):** Upload an image to provide visual inspiration or a direct design reference for the AI.

* **Live Preview:** Instantly see a live preview of the generated web application.

* **Code View & Copy:** Inspect the generated HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript code directly within the app, and easily copy it to your clipboard.

* **Iterative Design ("Follow Up"):** Request modifications to the existing design, allowing for a conversational and iterative development process.

* **Mobile/Full View Toggle:** Switch between mobile and full-screen views to test responsiveness.

* **Monochrome UI:** A clean, app-like user interface with a focus on shades of gray and white for a professional look.

* **Download & Share:** Download the generated HTML file to easily share or deploy your creations.

* **No API Keys Required:** Leverages Puter.js's "User Pays" model, making AI capabilities accessible without developers managing API keys or infrastructure costs.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/lourdjvke/AI-Code-Builder.git](https://github.com/lourdjvke/AI-Code-Builder.git)
    cd AI-Code-Builder
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No local server or build process is required!

3.  **Describe Your App:**
    In the initial chat interface, enter a detailed description of the web application you want to build (e.g., "A modern portfolio website with a dark theme, a navigation bar, a hero section with my name and profession, and a projects gallery.").

4.  **Upload an Image (Optional):**
    Click "Choose File" to upload an image that the AI can use as a reference for your design.

5.  **Generate & Preview:**
    Click "Send Design." The chat interface will disappear, and a live preview of your generated web app will appear.

6.  **Explore & Iterate:**

    * Use the **"Preview"** button to see the live rendering.

    * Use the **"Code"** button to view the generated HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

    * Click **"Copy"** to copy the code to your clipboard.

    * Click the **"Follow Up"** icon (pen-to-square) to request modifications to the current design.

    * Toggle between **"Mobile"** and **"Full"** views to test responsiveness.

    * Use **"Share"** to download the generated HTML file.

    * Click **"Reset"** to clear the current design and start a new one.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.

* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and responsive styling.

* **JavaScript:** For interactive functionality.

* **Puter.js:** The core SDK enabling serverless AI (GPT-4 Vision, DALL-E 3) and cloud features directly from the frontend.

* **Font Awesome:** For icons in the UI.

## üí° Future Enhancements

* **Advanced AI Interaction:** More sophisticated ways to guide the AI, perhaps with specific component requests or structural outlines.

* **Component Library:** Ability to save and reuse generated components.

* **Project Management:** Save multiple app projects within Puter.js cloud storage.

* **User Authentication:** Integrate Puter.js authentication for personalized experiences.

* **Direct Editing in Preview:** Allow users to directly manipulate elements in the preview and have the AI update the code.

* **Version Control:** Basic versioning of generated code.
